## Project Description
This repository contains the projects and assignments completed for the Algorithm and Data Structures Laboratory course. The projects are implemented in Java programming language.

## Tasks
<details>

<summary>Function and Recursion</summary>
  <details>
  <summary>Minimum value of array</summary>
  You are given a number "n" and an array of "n" elements, the function returns the minimum of them.
  </details>
  <details>
  <summary>Average value of array</summary>
  You are given a number "n" and an array of "n" elements, the function returns the average of them.
  </details>
  <details>
  <summary>Prime or Composite</summary>
  You are given the number "n", the function checks whether "n" is prime.
  </details>
  <details>
  <summary>Factorial</summary>
  You are given the number "n", write the function will find "n!" using recursion.
  </details>
  <details>
  <summary>Fibonacci sequence</summary>
  You are given a number “n”, the function for finding n-th elements in Fibonacci sequence using recursion.
  </details>
  <details>
  <summary>"a" degree "n"</summary>
  You are given numbers “a” and “n”, the function returns "a" degree "n".
  </details>
  <details>
  <summary>Reverse array</summary>
  You are given a number "n" and an array of "n" elements, the program returns the given array in reverse order using recursion.
  </details>
  <details>
  <summary>Binomial coefficient</summary>
  You are given numbers“n” and “k”,program finds $C_n^k$ (binomial coefficient) using formula:
  $$C_n^k=C_{n-1}^{k-1}+C_{n-1}^k$$ $$C_n^0=C_n^n=1$$
  </details>
  <details>
  <summary>GCD</summary>
  You are given “a” and “b”, the function finds GCD(a, b) using recursion and Euclidean Algorithm
  </details>
  </details>

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects in this repository, you will need to have JDK 20 installed on your computer. You can download JDK from the official website: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java20

## Usage
Once you have Java installed, you can clone this repository using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/nurasylkaiyr/ADS_Labaratory.git`

Each problem is implemented in a separate Java class with a main method. To run a problem, navigate to its directory and run the main Java file. For example, to run the problem in the "Problem1" directory, you would navigate to that directory and run the following command:

`javac Problem1.java`

`java Problem1`
